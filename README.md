This program simulates a simple version of the card game Blackjack. It prompts the user to decide whether they want another card (y/n) and then generates random playing cards (face value and suit) for the user. The program calculates the total sum of the face values of the cards the user receives and displays it after each card is drawn. The game continues until the user chooses not to receive another card or until the total sum exceeds 21, in which case the program declares the user as the loser. If the total sum reaches exactly 21, the user wins the game.
